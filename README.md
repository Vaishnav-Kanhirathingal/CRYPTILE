# CRYPTILE

> With improvement in cyber security tactics, there is also a much greater improvement in cyber attack tactics. With people storing their entire lives on their phones, it is a lot easier to access a weakpoint such as your mobile device and get access to documents that you thought were safe just lying around in your device. This kind of unauthorised access can flip somebody's life upside-down. So, it is always a better option to protect yourself against all types of attacks and prevent such a situation. Privacy is the key, encrypt everything.

> For app updates you can always check the release section.

## Purpose of CRYPTILE -

> This is an encryption application. it would take your files and encrypt them so that only you can see them. This can be useful when you have files that are important but, at the same time you want them accessible at all times. With CRYPTILE, you don't have to worry about having your data stolen. Since the only place the data will ever exist is on your physical device, no worry about any cloud provider having your data, nor of any other app being able to read it. It would be password locked and wouldn't be in readable format for anybody without the password/s. A safe is a term that would be a collection of such files.

## An example use case -

> Maybe you want some of your important business documents always with you. Here, you can create a safe with the name 'business'. This would help you identify the safe's purpose. Similarly, maybe you want to store your bank's papers. you can name the safe 'finance'. This would again similarly help you identify the safe's purpose.

### Main screen -

> This is the screen you will be shown after signing in. The application would ask for the device's media permissions to store the safe.

### Creating a safe -

> Creating a Safe is quite easy. Once on the main screen click the circular `+` button. This will navigate you to the `create safe` screen. Importing the safe will be discussed later on.

> In here, all you have to do is provide the application with the name of the safe, the password you want to give it. Now, here, you can use an additional password if you so require. Next you can also provide the safe with its own separate location. the default location is provided and changing that is optional. You can change the location using the image button on the right of the card. Select the folder where you want to create the safe. After selection, the path value should be updated in the app. Next up is the `Personal Access Only?` option. Enabling this option means only you can access the safe. When this option is enabled, the safe adds another layer of encryption using the key created while you signed up to the app. Disabling this means that you can access the safe with any account as long as you have the password. Next is the dial of level of encryption. This is pretty self explanatory. After you have made the necessary changes, click on the `confirm` button. This would create the safe and add it to the list.

### Importing a safe -

> For now, let's remove the safe we just created. click on the card with the safe's name. and long press the `-` and see what action it performs. It should say something along the lines of remove safe. Now, click on that option.

> Now that the safe is no longer stored in the database, we can import it. Click on the `+` icon on the home screen. and select the import option. Now navigate to the safe's directory and select the file named `META_DATA.txt` Now, the safe has been imported into the app.

### Interacting with the safe -

> Click on the safe with your safe's name and enter your passwords. Then, click the `open` button. Once that is done, to add a file to the safe, click on the `+` icon at the bottom of the screen. Then, navigate to the file you want to import and select it. Selecting the file would import it to the safe as below. If the safe directories are not found, the card will display a `!` sign as in the third image. If you attempt to open the error prone safe, a prompt to remove it from the app's database will be displayed.
